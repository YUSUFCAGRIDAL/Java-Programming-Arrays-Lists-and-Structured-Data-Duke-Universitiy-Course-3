Assignment 2: Two Keys
In this assignment, you will put together the CaesarCipherTwo class that encrypts a message with two keys (the same way as the previous lesson: key1 is used to encrypt every other letter, starting with the first, and key2 is used to encrypt every other letter, starting with the second), and also decrypts the same message. In addition you will create a second class, TestCaesarCipherTwo to test examples that use the CaesarCipherTwo class, including writing a method that will automatically decrypt an encrypted file by determining the two keys that were used to encrypt it. 

Specifically, you should do the following.

Create the CaesarCipherTwo class with the following parts:

Include private fields for the alphabet, shiftedAlphabet1, and shiftedAlphabet2.

Write a constructor CaesarCipherTwo that has two int parameters key1 and key2. This method should initialize all the private fields.

Write an encrypt method that has one String parameter named input. This method returns a String that is the input encrypted using the two shifted alphabets.

Write a decrypt method that has one String parameter named input. This method returns a String that is the encrypted String decrypted using the key1 and key2 associated with this CaesarCipherTwo object. You might want to add more private fields to the class.

Create the TestCaesarCipherTwo class with the following parts:

Include the methods halfOfString, countLetters, and maxIndex that you wrote in the previous lesson.

Write the void method simpleTests that has no parameters. This method should read in a file as a String, create a CaesarCipherTwo object with keys 17 and 3, encrypt the String using the CaesarCipherTwo object, print the encrypted String, and decrypt the encrypted String using the decrypt method.

Write the method breakCaesarCipher that has one String parameter named input. This method should figure out which keys were used to encrypt this message (in a similar manner as before), then create a CaesarCipherTwo object with that key and decrypt the message.

In the simpleTests method, add a call to breakCaesarCipher on the encrypted String to decrypt it automatically by determining the keys, and then print the decrypted String.
