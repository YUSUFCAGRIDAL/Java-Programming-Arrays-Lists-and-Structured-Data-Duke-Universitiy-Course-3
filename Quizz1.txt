Implementing the Caesar Cipher
Quiz 
Point

1. Question 1
Which one of the following shows how you could assign the character variable ch to the lowercase version of itself, without having to write any additional methods?

ch = Character.toLowerCase(ch);


2. Question 2
Consider writing the method isAorE that has one char parameter, ch. This method should return true if ch is either ‘a’ or ‘e’, and otherwise return false.

Which two of the following are correct implementations for the method isAorE?


1.
public boolean isAorE (char ch) {     
     if (ch == 'a') {        
          return true;          
     }          
     if (ch == 'e') {         
          return true;      
     }      
     return false;  
} 


1.
public boolean isAorE (char ch) {
     if (ch == 'a' || ch == 'e') { 
          return true; 
     }
     return false;
}


3. Question 3
Assume that isVowel is a method with one char parameter, and that this method returns true if that character is a vowel, and false if it is not a vowel.

Consider the following code to replace all vowels in a string phrase with a given character ch.

StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(phrase);       
for (int k=0; k < sb.length(); k++) {                  
     // MISSING CODE        
}
Which one of the following is the missing code to modify sb so that all vowels in sb are replaced with the character ch?


if (isVowel(sb.charAt(k))) {       
     sb.setCharAt(k, ch);
}

4. Question 4
Consider the following definition where phrase is a String.

StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(phrase);

Which two of the following are correct ways to ask if a character in the kth position of sb is equal to the character ch, when we want them to match regardless of case?


1.
if (Character.toLowerCase(sb.charAt(k)) == Character.toLowerCase(ch
    )) {



1.
char one = Character.toLowerCase(sb.charAt(k));       
char two = Character.toLowerCase(ch);       
if (one == two) {

5. Question 5

Encrypt the following phrase with Caesar Cipher key 15.

At noon be in the conference room with your hat on for a surprise party. YELL LOUD!

What is the encrypted string?

(Note: Your encrypted string should preserve spacing and punctuation.)

6. Question 6

Encrypt the following phrase with the algorithm described for using two Caesar Cipher keys, with key1 = 8 and key2 = 21.
