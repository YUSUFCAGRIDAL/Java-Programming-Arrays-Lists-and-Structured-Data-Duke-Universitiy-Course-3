Object Oriented Caesar Cipher
Quiz pour s'exercer, 4 questions

1. Question 1
Which of the following options is the best choice for adding an additional private field to the CaesarCipher class to make it easier to call the decrypt method on a string that was encrypted using an object of this class?

The integer key which is a parameter to the constructor.

2. Question 2
Which one of the following best describes the approach for the decrypt method that has one String parameter encrypted?
Assume decrypt can also access the key parameter that was used in the constructor, and that value is stored in an instance variable named mainKey in the constructor.

Two lines are needed:

CaesarCipher cc = new CaesarCipher(26-mainKey); 
return cc.encrypt(encrypted);

3. Question 3

Which one of the following is the best idea for the method breakCaesarCipher?

Calculate the frequency of all the letters using countLetters and compute the index of the largest frequency using maxIndex. Use those values to determine the key, then create a CaesarCipher with that key and call decrypt on the encrypted string.


4. Question 4

In the class TestCaesarCipher, should the method countLetters be public or private?

private
