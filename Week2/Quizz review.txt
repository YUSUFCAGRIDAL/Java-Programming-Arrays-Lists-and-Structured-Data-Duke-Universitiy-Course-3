Quiz, 19 questions

1. Question 1
Consider the first version of GladLibs we saw in this lesson, which stores label substitutions in ArrayLists. Assume an ArrayList named wordsUsed will keep track of words used as replacements so no replacement word will be used more than once. The code below was used as part of a program by a learner in the method processWord. The learner's program runs but still results in duplicate words sometimes.


String sub = getSubstitute(w.substring(first+1,last));
while (true) {
    if (wordsUsed.contains(sub)) {
        sub = getSubstitute(w.substring(first+1,last));
        break;
    }
    else {
        wordsUsed.add(sub);
    }
}
Which one of the following best explains why this code still returns duplicates sometimes?

If a word is a repeated word, then this code gets another random word and uses that second word without checking to see if it is a repeated word.



2. Question 2
Consider the first version of GladLibs we saw in this lesson, which you modified so there would not be duplicate words chosen for the story. Assume an instance variable is used to keep track of the total number of word tags that are replaced.

Which one of the following methods is most likely where that variable is updated?

processWord


3. Question 3
Consider the class WordFrequencies, which you wrote in an assignment, that can determine facts about words in a file.

How many unique words are in the file errors.txt?

3721

4. Question 4
Consider the class WordFrequencies, which you wrote in an assignment, that can determine facts about words in a file.

Which word occurs the most often in the file errors.txt?

(You should lowercase all words and include the punctuation as part of a word. Thus, “end.” is different than “end”, but “All” is the same as “all”.)

of 

5. Question 5
Consider the class WordFrequencies, which you wrote in an assignment, that can determine facts about words in a file.

Find the word that occurs the most often in the file errors.txt.

(You should lowercase all words and include the punctuation as part of a word. Thus, “end.” is different than “end”, but “All” is the same as “all”.)

How many times does the most common word occur?

609

6. Question 6
Consider the class CharactersInPlay, which you wrote in an assignment, that determines who the characters were in one of Shakespeare’s plays and also how many lines they had.

What is the name of the character with the third most speaking parts in the file errors.txt?

ADRIANA

7. Question 7
Consider the class CharactersInPlay, which you wrote in an assignment, that determines who the characters were in one of Shakespeare’s plays and also how many lines they had.

Find the name of the character with the third most speaking parts in the file errors.txt. How many speaking parts does this person have?

79

8. Question 8
Consider the class CharactersInPlay, which you wrote in an assignment, that determines who the characters were in one of Shakespeare’s plays and also how many lines they had.

How many characters in the file errors.txt have at least 10 speaking parts, but no more than 15 speaking parts?

3
9. Question 9
Consider the class you wrote to find out how many times each codon occurs in a strand of DNA based on reading frames. The file dnaMystery2 represents a long strand of DNA.

How many unique codons are there if you use a reading frame that starts at position 1?

32

10. Question 10
Consider the class you wrote to find out how many times each codon occurs in a strand of DNA based on reading frames. The file dnaMystery2 represents a long strand of DNA.

What is the number of occurrences of the codon that occurs the most often using a reading frame that starts at position 2?

12

11. Question 11
Consider the class you wrote to find out how many times each codon occurs in a strand of DNA based on reading frames. The file dnaMystery2 represents a long strand of DNA.

Using a reading frame that starts at position 0, which of the following codons occur 7 times? (Select all that are correct.)

CAG

CAA

12. Question 12
Consider the class WordsInFiles, which you wrote in an assignment, that determines which words occur in several files, and for each word, which files they occur in.

Consider the seven files: caesar.txt, confucius.txt, errors.txt, hamlet.txt, likeit.txt, macbeth.txt, and romeo.txt.

How many words are there that each occur in all seven files?

570

13. Question 13
Consider the class WordsInFiles, which you wrote in an assignment, that determines which words occur in several files, and for each word, which files they occur in.

Consider the seven files: caesar.txt, confucius.txt, errors.txt, hamlet.txt, likeit.txt, macbeth.txt and romeo.txt.

How many words are there that each occur in four of the seven files?

826

14. Question 14
Consider the class WordsInFiles, which you wrote in an assignment, that determines which words occur in several files, and for each word, which files they occur in.

Consider the seven files: caesar.txt, confucius.txt, errors.txt, hamlet.txt, likeit.txt, macbeth.txt and romeo.txt.

In which file does the word “sea” NOT appear?

(Consider only the exact lowercase string "sea". "SEA" or "sea." would be different words.)

likeit.txt

15. Question 15 
Consider the class WordsInFiles, which you wrote in an assignment, that determines which words occur in several files, and for each word, which files they occur in.

Consider the seven files: caesar.txt, confucius.txt, errors.txt, hamlet.txt, likeit.txt, macbeth.txt and romeo.txt.

In which of the following files does the word “tree” appear? (Choose all that apply.)

(Consider only the exact lowercase string "tree". "TREE" or "tree." would be different words.)

confucius.txt
likeit.txt
macbeth.txt
romeo.txt


16. Question 16
Consider the map version of GladLibs where a map is created that maps a category to a list of words in that category.

In which method are the individual ArrayLists of words for categories created?


17. Question 17
Consider the map version of GladLibs where a map is created that maps a category to a list of words in that category. In which method are these individual ArrayLists of words placed into the HashMap?

initializeFromSource

18. Question 18
Consider the map version of GladLibs and consider the method totalWordsInMap that returns the total number of words in all the ArrayLists in the HashMap myMap.

Which two of the following code possibilities compute this sum of total number of words in the variable sum?


int sum = 0;
for (String category : myMap.keySet()) {
    sum += myMap.get(category).size();
}

int sum = 0;      
for (String category : myMap.keySet()) {
    ArrayList<String> words = myMap.get(category);
    sum += words.size();
}


19. Question 19
Consider the map version of GladLibs and consider the method totalWordsConsidered that returns the total number of words in the ArrayLists of the categories that were used for a particular GladLib. Assume a private variable of type ArrayList<String> and named categoriesUsed is used to store the unique categories found as the GladLib is created.

In which method would we put a category into this ArrayList?
