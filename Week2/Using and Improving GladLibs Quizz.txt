4. Question 4
Consider the five files with plays by Shakespeare: caesar.txt, hamlet.txt, likeit.txt, macbeth.txt, and romeo.txt.
How many words are there that occur in five files?


5. Question 5

How many words are there that each appear in four of the five files?

726

8. Question 8
In the first version of GladLibs we saw in this lesson, assume an ArrayList named wordsUsed will store words that are used as replacements, so no replacement word will be used more than once. Which one of the following could be the MISSING CODE for the code below in GladLibs to make sure that no word is used twice?

String sub = getSubstitute(w.substring(first+1,last));
while (true) {
    [MISSING CODE]
}

if (! wordsUsed.contains(sub)) {
    wordsUsed.add(sub);
    break;           
}
sub = getSubstitute(w.substring(first+1,last));


/*
* sub = getSubstitute(w.substring(first+1,last));
* if (! wordsUsed.contains(sub)) {
*    wordsUsed.add(sub);
*    break;
*}
*/


9. Question 9 [Correct]
Consider the map version of GladLibs, and consider the method totalWordsInMap that returns the total number of words in all the ArrayLists in the HashMap myMap. Which one of the following is the best choice for the loop in this method?


for (String category : myMap.keySet()) {



10. Question 10
Consider the map version of GladLibs, and consider the method totalWordsConsidered that returns the total number of words in the ArrayLists of the categories that were used for a particular GladLib. What type of private instance variable would be the best choice to solve this problem?


An ArrayList of Strings representing the unique categories used.
This ArrayList can then be used after the GladLibs is complete to determine the total number in each of the categories.
